# timetracker_transitiontool

## Description

Short small one off application to transition db layouts from my previous
timetracker (archived C++ verison) to the new version (current Rust version).

Doesn't have any special particular features. If you want to only pick data
from a certain day forth from the old db to use in the new one, you can simply
adjust some of the SQL queries in the db.

Make backups before use
